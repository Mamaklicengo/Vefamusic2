Security Policy
Reporting a Vulnerability
If there are any vulnerabilities in YukkiMusicBot, don't hesitate to report them.

Use any of the private contact addresses.

Describe the vulnerability.

If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize it in your message!

We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.

Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix is released!

Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
